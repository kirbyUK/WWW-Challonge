=head1 NAME

WWW::Challonge::Participant - A class representing a single participant within
a Challonge tournament.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.20

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.20';

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 new

Takes a hashref representing the participant, the API key and the REST client
and turns it into an object. This is mostly used by the module itself, to
create a new participant within a tournament see
L<WWW::Challonge::Tournament/participant_create>.

	my $p = WWW::Challonge::Participant->new($participant, $key, $client);

=cut

sub new
{
	my $class = shift;
	my $participant = shift;
	my $key = shift;
	my $client = shift;

	my $p =
	{
		alive => 1,
		client => $client,
		participant => $participant->{participant},
		key => $key,
	};
	bless $p, $class;
}

=head2 update

Updates specific attributes of a participant. For a full list, see
L<WWW::Challonge::Tournament/participant_create>. Unlike that method, however,
all arguments are optional.

	$p->update({
		name => "test2",
		seed => 1
	});

=cut

sub update
{
	my $self = shift;
	my $args = shift;

	# Do not operate on a dead participant:
	return __is_kill unless($self->{alive});

	# Get the key, REST client, tournament url and id:
	my $key = $self->{key};
	my $client = $self->{client};
	my $url = $self->{participant}->{tournament_id};
	my $id = $self->{participant}->{id};

	# Check the arguments and values are valid:
	return undef unless(WWW::Challonge::Participant::__args_are_valid($args));

	# Add the API key and put everything else in a 'participant' hash:
	my $params = { api_key => $key, participant => $args };

	# Make the PUT request:
	$client->PUT("/tournaments/$url/participants/$id.json", to_json($params),
		{ "Content-Type" => 'application/json' });

	# Check if it was successful:
	if($client->responseCode > 300)
	{
		my $errors = from_json($client->responseContent)->{errors};
		for my $error(@{$errors})
		{
			carp "$error" . " (" . $client->responseCode . ")";
		}
		return undef;
	}

	# If so, set the object's attributes to the updated version:
	$self->{participant} = from_json($client->responseContent)->{participant};
}

=head2 check_in

Checks in the participant to the tournament.

	$p->check_in;

=cut

sub check_in
{
	my $self = shift;

	# Do not operate on a dead participant:
	return __is_kill unless($self->{alive});

	# Get the key, REST client, tournament url and id:
	my $key = $self->{key};
	my $client = $self->{client};
	my $url = $self->{participant}->{tournament_id};
	my $id = $self->{participant}->{id};

	# Add the API key:
	my $params = to_json({ api_key => $key });

	# Make the POST call:
	$client->POST("/tournaments/$url/participants/$id/check_in.json", $params,
		{ "Content-Type" => 'application/json' });

	# Check if it was successful:
	if($client->responseCode > 300)
	{
		my $errors = from_json($client->responseContent)->{errors};
		for my $error(@{$errors})
		{
			carp "$error" . " (" . $client->responseCode . ")";
		}
		return undef;
	}
}

=head2 destroy

If the tournament has not started, deletes the associated participant. If the
tournament has started, the participant is marked inactive and their matches
are automatically forfeited.

	$p->destroy;

	# $p still contains the participant, but any future operations will fail:
	$p->update({ name => "test2" }); # ERROR!

=cut

sub destroy
{
	my $self = shift;

	# Do not operate on a dead participant:
	return __is_kill unless($self->{alive});

	# Get the key, REST client, tournament url and id:
	my $key = $self->{key};
	my $client = $self->{client};
	my $url = $self->{participant}->{tournament_id};
	my $id = $self->{participant}->{id};

	# Make the DELETE call:
	$client->DELETE("/tournaments/$url/participants/$id.json?api_key=$key");

	# Check if it was successful:
	if($client->responseCode > 300)
	{
		my $errors = from_json($client->responseContent)->{errors};
		for my $error(@{$errors})
		{
			carp "$error" . " (" . $client->responseCode . ")";
		}
		return undef;
	}

	# If so, set the alive key to false to prevent further operations:
	$self->{alive} = 0;
}

=head2 randomize

Randomises the seeds among participants. Only applicable before a tournament
has started. Affects all participants in the tournament.

	$p->randomize;

=cut

sub randomize
{
	my $self = shift;

	# Do not operate on a dead participant:
	return __is_kill unless($self->{alive});

	# Get the key, REST client and tournament url:
	my $key = $self->{key};
	my $client = $self->{client};
	my $url = $self->{participant}->{tournament_id};

	# Add the API key:
	my $params = to_json({ api_key => $key });

	# Make the POST call:
	$client->POST("/tournaments/$url/participants/randomize.json", $params,
		{ "Content-Type" => 'application/json' });

	# Check if it was successful:
	if($client->responseCode > 300)
	{
		my $errors = from_json($client->responseContent)->{errors};
		for my $error(@{$errors})
		{
			carp "$error" . " (" . $client->responseCode . ")";
		}
		return undef;
	}

	return 1;
}

=head2 attributes

the following fields.

=head2 __is_kill

Returns an error explaining that the current tournament has been destroyed and
returns undef, used so a function doesn't attempt to operate on a tournament
that has been successfully destroyed.

=cut

{
	carp "Participant has been destroyed";
	return undef;
}

=head2 __args_are_valid

Checks if the passed arguments and values are valid for creating or updating
a tournament.

	# Check it is a hashref:
	unless(ref $args eq "HASH")

	# Validate the inputs:
	for my $arg(@{$valid_args{string}})
	{
		next unless(defined $args->{$arg});
		# Most of the string-based arguments require individual validation
		# based on what they are:
		if($arg =~ /^misc$/)
		{
			if(length $args->{$arg} > 255)
			{
				carp "'$arg' input is too long (max. 255 characters)";
			}
		}

	for my $arg(@{$valid_args{integer}})

		{
			carp "Value '" . $args->{$arg} . "' is not a valid integer for " .
				"argument '" . $arg . "'";
			return undef;
		}
	}

	# Finally, check if there are any unrecognised arguments, but just ignore
	# them instead of erroring out:
	my @accepted_inputs = (

		@{$valid_args{integer}},
	);
	my $is_valid = 0;
