=head1 NAME

WWW::Challonge::Match::Attachment - A class representing a single match
attachement within a Challonge tournament.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.31

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.31';

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 new

Takes a hashref representing the match attachment, the tournament id, the API
key and the REST client and turns it into an object. This is mostly used by the
module itself. To see how to create a match attachment, see
L<WWW::Challonge::Match/create>.

	my $ma = WWW::Challonge::Match::Attachment->new($match, $id, $key, $client);

=cut

sub new
{
	my $class = shift;
	my $attachment = shift;
	my $tournament = shift;
	my $key = shift;
	my $client = shift;

	my $ma =
	{
		client => $client,
		attachment => $attachment->{match_attachment},
		tournament => $tournament,
		key => $key,
		alive => 1,
	};
	bless $ma, $class;
}

=head2 update

Updates the attributes of the match attachment. Takes the same arguments as
L<WWW::Challonge::Match/create>.

	$ma->update({ url => "https://www.example.com/example2.png" });

=cut

sub update
{
	my $self = shift;
	my $args = shift;

	# Do not operate on a dead attachment:
	return __is_kill unless($self->{alive});

	# Get the key, REST client, tournament url and id:
	my $key = $self->{key};
	my $client = $self->{client};
	my $url = $self->{tournament};
	my $match_id = $self->{attachment}->{match_id};
	my $id = $self->{attachment}->{id};
	my $HOST = $WWW::Challonge::HOST;

	# Check the arguments are valid:
	return undef
		unless(WWW::Challonge::Match::Attachment::__args_are_valid($args));

	# Wrap the filename in an arrayref for HTTP::Request::Common:
	$args->{asset} = [ $args->{asset} ] if(defined $args->{asset});

	# Make the PUT call:
	my @params = map { "match_attachment[" . $_ . "]" => $args->{$_} }
		keys %{$args};
	my $request = POST(
		"$HOST/tournaments/$url/matches/$match_id/attachments/$id.json",
		"Content-Type" => 'form-data',
		"Content" => [ "api_key" => $key, @params ],
	);
	$request->method('PUT'); # Ew...
	my $response = $client->request($request);

	# Check for any errors:
	WWW::Challonge::__handle_error $response if($response->is_error);

	return 1;
}

=head2 destroy

Deletes the match attachment from the attached match.

	$ma->destroy;

	# $ma still contains the attachment, but any future operations will fail:
	$ma->update({ url => "https://example.com" }); # ERROR!

=cut

sub destroy
{
	my $self = shift;

	# Do not operate on a dead attachment:
	return __is_kill unless($self->{alive});

	# Get the key, REST client, tournament url and id:
	my $key = $self->{key};
	my $client = $self->{client};
	my $url = $self->{tournament};
	my $match_id = $self->{attachment}->{match_id};
	my $id = $self->{attachment}->{id};
	my $HOST = $WWW::Challonge::HOST;

	# Make the DELETE call:
	my $response = $client->delete(
		"$HOST/tournaments/$url/matches/$match_id/attachments/$id.json?api_key=$key");

	# Check for any errors:
	WWW::Challonge::__handle_error $response if($response->is_error);

	# If not, mark the object as dead:
	$self->{alive} = 0;

	return 1;
}

=head2 attributes

Returns a hashref of all the attributes of the match attachment. Contains the
following fields.

	# Get the most recent version:
	my $response = $client->get(
		"$HOST/tournaments/$url/matches/$match_id/attachments/$id.json?api_key=$key");

	# Check for any errors:
	WWW::Challonge::__handle_error $response if($response->is_error);

	# If not, save the most recent and return it:
	$client->{attachment} =
		from_json($response->decoded_content)->{match_attachment};
	return $client->{attachment};
}

=head2 __args_are_valid

Checks if the passed arguments and values are valid for updating a match
attachment.

=cut

	my $args = shift;

	for my $arg(keys %{$args})
	{

				return undef;
			}
		}

		{
			if($args->{$arg} !~ m{^(?:https?|ftp)://})
			{
				carp "URL must start with 'http://', 'https://' or 'ftp://'";
				return undef;
			}
		}
		elsif($arg ne "description")
		{
			carp "Ignoring unrecognised argument '" . $args->{$arg} . "'";
			delete $args->{$arg};
		}
	}

	return 1;
}

=head2 __is_kill

Checks the attachment has not been deleted from Challonge with
L<WWW::Challonge::Match::Attachment/destroy>.
