=head1 NAME

WWW::Challonge::Match - A class representing a single match within
a Challonge tournament.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.31

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.31';

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 new

Takes a hashref representing the match, the API key and the REST client and
turns it into an object. This is mostly used by the module itself.

	my $m = WWW::Challonge::Match->new($match, $key, $client);

=cut

sub new
{
	my $class = shift;
	my $match = shift;
	my $key = shift;
	my $client = shift;

	my $m =
	{
		client => $client,
		match => $match->{match},
		key => $key,
	};
	bless $m, $class;
}

=head2 update

Updates the match with the results. Requires an arrayref of comma-seperated
values and optional arguments for votes. The 'winner_id' is not required as the
module calculates it. Returns the updated C<WWW::Challonge::Match> object:

=over 4

=item scores_csv

Required. An arrayref containing the match results with the following format -
"x-y", where x and y are both integers, x being player 1's score and y being
player 2's.

=item player1_votes

Integer. Overwrites the number of votes for player 1.

=item player2_votes

Integer. Overwrites the number of votes for player 2.

=back

	# If votes are not given, the argument can simply be an arrayref:
	$m->update(["1-3", "3-2", "3-0"]);

	# Otherwise, a hashref is required:
	$m->update({
		scores_csv => ["1-3", "3-2", "3-0"],
		player1_votes => 2,
		player2_votes => 1,
	});

		$params->{match}->{scores_csv} = join ",", @{$results};

		# Go through and add the prediction arguments if they exist:

		{
			for my $key(keys %{$args})
			{
				next unless($key =~ /^player[12]_votes$/);
				$params->{match}->{$key} = $args->{$key};
			}
		}

		# Make the PUT call:
		my $response = $client->request(WWW::Challonge::__json_request(
			"$HOST/tournaments/$url/matches/$id.json", "PUT", $params));

		# Check for any errors:
		WWW::Challonge::__handle_error $response if($response->is_error);

		return 1;
