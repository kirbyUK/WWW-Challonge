=head1 NAME

WWW::Challonge - Perl wrapper for the Challonge API

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.31

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.31';
our $HOST = "https://api.challonge.com/v1";

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Access the Challonge API within Perl. Contains all the functions within the API,
as documented L<here|http:://api.challonge.com/v1>.

    use WWW::Challonge;

    my $c = WWW::Challonge->new($api_key)
    ...

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 new

Creates a new C<WWW::Challonge> object. Takes in an API key, which is required,
and optionally a preconfigured L<LWP::UserAgent> object, which is mostly used for
testing.

    my $c  = WWW::Challonge->new($api_key);
	my $c2 = WWW::Challonge->new({ key => $api_key, client => $my_client });

=cut

sub new
{
	# Get the arguments:
	my $class = shift;
	my $args = shift;

	my $key;
	my $client;

	# If the argument is a scalar, use it as the API key:
	if((! ref $args) && (defined $args))
	{
		$key = $args;

		# Create an LWP useragent to interface Challonge:
		$client = LWP::UserAgent->new;
	}
	elsif(ref $args eq "HASH")
	{
		croak "'client' must be a LWP::UserAgent object"
			unless((defined $args->{client}) &&
			(UNIVERSAL::isa($args->{client}, "LWP::UserAgent")));

		$client = $args->{client};
		$key = $args->{key} // "";
	}
	else
	{
		croak "Expected scalar or hashref";
	}

	# Try to get some content and check the response code:
	my $response = $client->get("$HOST/tournaments.json?api_key=$key");

	# Check for any errors:
	WWW::Challonge::__handle_error $response if($response->is_error);

	# Create and return the object:
	my $c = { key => $key, client => $client };
	bless $c, $class;
}

	# Check for any errors:
	WWW::Challonge::__handle_error $response if($response->is_error);

	# Make a new tournament object for every tourney returned:

specify like so:

	my $client = $self->{client};

	# Try to get the tournament:
	my $response = $client->get("$HOST/tournaments/$url.json?api_key=$key");

	# Check for any errors:
	WWW::Challonge::__handle_error $response if($response->is_error);

	# Otherwise create a tourney with the object and return it:

		from_json($response->decoded_content), $key, $client);
	return $tourney;
}
